## Contributions

This project is still under very early development so large pull requests are
discouraged, in the meanwhile if you have great ideas and don't want to wait
for my slow review, feel free to fork this project and I'll be happy to
link your fork here.

## License

Chie is licensed under GPL, and will be relicensed to MIT on March 20th, 2028.
I'm taking this approach because I want to discourage closed-source software to
take advantage of open source in its early development.

Because of the future relicense, I'll ask contributors to sign an agreement.

The files under `types/` are published under public domain, which means you can
use arbitrary license for Chie extensions.
