# Chie API Types

This package provides TypeScript type definitions for extensions developed for
[the Chie app](https://chie.app).

To use this package, add it to the `devDependencies` field of your extension's
`package.json` file, with the version that corresponds to the Chie app version
you are targeting. For an example of a bare-metal extension, you can check the
[chie-extension-empty](https://github.com/chieapp/chie-extension-empty)
repository.

To enhance the discoverability of your extension, it is recommended to include
`"chie-extension"` as one of the `keywords` in your extension's `package.json`
file. This will help users find your extension more easily.
